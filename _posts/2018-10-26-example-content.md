title: Making a first contribution in Outreachy usability testing
published: true
---

For my contribution I had to make a 5-person usability test, using a recent version of GNOME, generate a heat map of the results, then write a brief summary about the experience

**Test method:**

For the test I used a laptop running the Fedora 28 operating system with the GNOME desktop.
I took the scenario tasks from a previous usability intern [Gina Dobrescu](https://ginadobrescu.wordpress.com/outreachy-program/week-5-sketching-out-the-scenario-tasks/).
There were 5 volunteers to test two GNOME applications: a calendar and Evince PDF viewer. All of them have never used GNOME before and have seen it for the first time, though 3 of them are daily Windows/OS X users, two of them use a computer frequently, but not every day. The total time was from 5 to 10 min for all five scenario tasks. During the test I was sitting behind and taking notes.

**Here are the scenario tasks**

*Calendar:*
1. Your boss just called, and cannot make it to a meeting with you. Your boss asked you to move the meeting to another time. Please create a new meeting for October 25, 2018, from 2:00pm until 4:00pm .  
2.  Set a reminder 10 minutes before the start, so you don't forget that meeting.  

*PDF:*
1. You want to read the story, but you forgot where you saved the book. Please find the "Cinderella.pdf" document and open it.   
2. While you are reading, you want to be comfortable, so you make the document scroll by itself.   
3. The break is over, but the next time you will want to remember the last page you've read (in this case the 4th page). Please bookmark this page, with the name "the shoes".

**Test results:**

Both calendar tasks were easy for participants and they completed them quickly. All of them also found PDF file without any problems. Autoscroll was a bit more difficult for them. Only 2 participants clicked the right mouse button first, others were trying to find this option in “File Options” and “View Options”, and only after a few attempts managed to find it. This task took 2 min on average, one of the participants needed more than 5 minutes. And adding the bookmark was quite confusing for two participants, they were trying to add it through right-click button. Renaming the bookmark wasn't a problem for anyone.
